# kubernetes installation with bash
In this bash, I have put all the kubernetes installation requirements and just run it with the following command and use it.
Note: The installed version should be the latest version, because the latest one has a problem,
and in addition, the network in the cluster has been set up with flannel.
```
bash k8s.sh 
or 
chmod +x k8s.sh
```
